# Morse Code Translator Project

The is my morse-code repository page. This project has a functional english to morse code translator, along with the reverse.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to show my working knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, CSS. It was mainly done with tests in mind, and each core function can be individually tested.

## Process

This project was Test Drive Development, where the tests were written prior to the bulk of the code. After I had declared my edge cases, coding had begun. The bulk of this was around making sure the functions worked correctly, splitting up the functions into a more modular design. A bit of HTML and CSS styling was added to make it look more aesthetic.
